# C++ primitive type boxing

This is a small header-only library for easing primitive type boxing in C++.

I created this library to aid code health in [Contour Terminal Emulator](https://github.com/christianparpart/contour/).

This header can be simply copied into a project or used via CMake builtin
functions, such as `FetchContent`.
